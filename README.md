# aMAZEr
program that solves (unconventionally) mazes in the shortest path 
it was not meant to be elegant, or super efficeint but a challagne to see if I can doing it the way I did it.
the way it solves the maze is through recursivly checking each direction until it finds the end.
the find the shortest path it sovles the maze using each of the orderings of checking up, down, left, and right.
also there are many tricks I implimented to improve the time, such as using the asumption that the largest maze I need to salve is 10x10
I could calculate the maximum shortest path possible and never go farther than that recursive depth.
